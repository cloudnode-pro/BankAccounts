## Features

### Multiple Accounts/Balances
Players can have multiple independent bank accounts. You can have both personal and business accounts.

### Transaction History
See the history of your account’s transactions using the `/bank history` command.

### Payment Requests (Invoices)
Request money from players and track the payment status.

### Vault Support

If [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault/releases/latest) is installed on your server,
you can [enable its integration in the configuration](https://github.com/cloudnode-pro/BankAccounts/blob/dad253525b6bc3ee9647cd01c75e2c425a921f58/src/main/resources/config.yml#L38-L44).
This allows BankAccounts to function as a Vault economy provider,
enabling compatibility with third-party plugins that support Vault.

### POS and Bank Cards

You can create a [Point of Sale](https://github.com/cloudnode-pro/BankAccounts/wiki/POS), which is a type of single-use chest shop. Players can pay using a bank card (`/bank card`).

### Extensive Configuration

All functionality is fully configurable. See [default config](https://github.com/cloudnode-pro/BankAccounts/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml).
